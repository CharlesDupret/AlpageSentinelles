# AlpageSentinelles

This is my end of study project in the context of [AlpageSentinelles](https://www.alpages-sentinelles.fr/) action and 
realized with [Pacte](https://www.pacte-grenoble.fr/) laboratory  based in France, Grenoble. This project is about a 
classification of mountain pasture characteristics from Sentinel-2 spectral images. 

**Goals**: Show how remote sensing can help to:

  - Maps mountain pastures
  - Better understanding impact of climate change
  - Improve sheep management


***


## Outline

  1. [`ImageImporter`](ImageImporter): Cut and unzip Sentinel2 images then apply 
[masks](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-2-msi/level-1c/masks) according area of 
interest around alpine pasture establish by [AlpageSentinelles](https://www.alpages-sentinelles.fr/).

  2. [`DatasetBuilder`](DatasetBuilder): Build a dataset based on the ground truth establish by
     [AlpageSentinelles](https://www.alpages-sentinelles.fr/).
  
     
### Structure of the project

  - `data`: That folder contains datas used in this project. Some data are imported in GitHub like datasets. Other are
just local. All datas generated by project's scripts will be stored by default in this folder.

  - `doc`: Reports and other project related documents

  - `environement.yaml`: the setting of developing environment used

  - `log`: All running logs will be generated in a **log** folder (not imported in GitHub)


## About development

Scripts are working, but consider that they are not that robust. Specifically about passing, exceptions and errors.
This version still very dependent on data organisation and that all inputs datas match (name, no file missing...)

If you want to continue or just helps in the development of this project please consider the `How to improve ?`
section in README of each package.


## Glossary 
  - `Tile` or `Tile Cube`: All data about the 100km by 100km area (bands, time series, mask).
  - `Slice`: A spectral images at one a given date.
  - `Bands`: One or several bands corresponding to a spectral image at one date.
  - `Layer`: A band or a mask of spectral image.
  - `Mask`: Sentinel2 mask used to remove clouds and snow.
